#GoPiGo in C

This repository contains source code, firmware and design materials for the GoPiGo in the C Language.

#####To Compile:  gcc gopigo.c [your_file_name.c] -o gopigo -Wall
#####To run: ./gopigo

**Notes:**
- The compile command uses the basic commands from gopigo.c library 
- The output exectuable is the one followed by the -o argument, which is gopigo here (You can change it to something else if oyu want)
- the -Wall argument enable's all compiler warnings and is necessary for compiling the GoPiGo C example. Read more about it here: http://www.rapidtables.com/code/linux/gcc/gcc-wall.htm
