# Program the GoPiGo in Scratch

You can program the GoPiGo in Scratch.  This repo contains support programs and example programs to help you program the [GoPiGo](http://www.dexterindustries.com/GoPiGo) in Scratch.

The GoPiGo is a delightful and complete robot for the Raspberry Pi that turns your Pi into a fully operating robot.  GoPiGo is a mobile robotic platform for the Raspberry Pi developed by [Dexter Industries.](http://www.dexterindustries.com/GoPiGo).
